- There is a wide range of genetic diversity of dry beans, which is the most produced among the edible legume crops globally. Seed quality is influential in crop production. Therefore, seed classification is essential for both marketing and production to provide the principles of sustainable agricultural systems. The primary objective of this study is to provide a method for obtaining uniform seed varieties from crop production, which is in the form of population, so the seeds are not certified as a sole variety.
- Seven different types of dry beans were used in this research, taking into account the features such as form, shape, type and structure by the Turkish Standards Institute and the market situation. They are called Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Dermosan, Horoz and Sira.
